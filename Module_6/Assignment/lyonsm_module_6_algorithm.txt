    - add the song details to the music collection dictionary
    with key, value pairs (title, artist)

    entries, they receive an error message and the program
    exits immediately

    to retrieve via its title

    warn the user that the song does not exist in the collection
    - if the song exists, retrieve it and print confirmation 
    message
