Description: 

This program begins with the creation of the Personnel class,
which will serve as the parent or super class for child classes
Doctor, Surgeon, and Nurse. 

Each child class inherits the attributes name, age, and hourly
rate and the display method from the Personnel class.

Each child class then builds on those attributes and methods to
add and display information specific to each child class.

Finally, each child class is instantiated to display an example
instance of each object.
