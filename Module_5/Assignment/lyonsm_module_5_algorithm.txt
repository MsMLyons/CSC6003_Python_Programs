Description: 

This program begins with the creation of the Personnel class,
which will serve as the parent or super class for child classes
Doctor, Surgeon, and Nurse. 

Each child class inherits the attributes name, age, and hourly
rate and the display method from the Personnel class.

Each child class then builds on those attributes and methods to
add and display information specific to each child class.

Finally, each child class is instantiated to display an example
instance of each object.
"""

Step 1: Create the parent class Personnel
    - instantiate the class with the __init__ method
    - add required attributes: name, age, hourly rate
    - add required method: display

Step 2: Create the child class Doctor
    - instantiate with inherited attributes: name, age, hourly rate 
    - add required new attribute: specialty
    - add displayDoctor method that inherits properties from the 
      display method in the parent class Personnel
      - display all inherited and new attributes

Step 3: Create the child class Surgeon
    - instantiate with inherited attributes: name, age, hourly rate 
    - add required new attribute: boardCertified
    - add displaySurgeon method that inherits properties from the 
      display method in the parent class Personnel
      - display all inherited and new attributes

Step 4: Create the child class Nurse
    - instantiate with inherited attributes: name, age, hourly rate 
    - add required new attribute: rank
    - add displayNurse method that inherits properties from the 
      display method in the parent class Personnel
      - display all inherited and new attributes

Step 5: Create objects for each child class
    - instantiate objects with example data
    - test each display method by calling them via the example
      objects
