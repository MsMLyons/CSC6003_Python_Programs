Description: 

This program creates two classes. The Rectangle class is the 
parent class, from which the Parallelepiped child class inherits 
the attributes of length and width. 

The Rectangle class initializes these attributes via user input, 
then uses the input data to calculate the perimeter and area of a 
rectangle. Before passing that information onto its child class, the 
results of the input and calculations are displayed for the user. 

The Parallelepiped class takes advantage of inheritance by re-
utilizing user input of length and width, then prompts the user for
the shape's height. With this data, it calculates the volume of the
shape and prints the results for the user.
