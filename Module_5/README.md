Assume you are working in a hospital and are maintaining personnel records on doctors, surgeons, and nurses

To do this, you need to create the Personnel class. Create three types of personnel -- a child class Doctor,  a child class Surgeon, and a child class Nurse. Create attributes name, age, and hourlyRate

Create a display() method that displays the name and age of an object created via the Personnel class.
Create child classes Doctor, Surgeon, and Nurse which inherit from the personnel class. The Doctor class also has a specialty attribute. The Surgeon class has a boardCertified attribute, and the nurse  has a rank attribute.
Create methods displayDoctor(),  and displaySurgeon(), and displayNurse() that displays the name, age, specialty, board certification status, and rank accordingly of an object created via the child classes.
Create an doctor, surgeon, and  nurse objects via an instantiation on the classes and then test the displayDoctor, displaySurgeon, and displayNurse methods.
