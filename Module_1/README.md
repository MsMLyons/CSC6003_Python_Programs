You are to write a program that prompts the user to enter a radius of a circle/sphere. Using the radius that is entered, the program must calculate and display the circumference and area of a circle and the volume of a sphere with that radius and then print the results to the screen. 

The program output should look as follows:

Enter the radius:

2.75

The circumference of a circle with a radius of 2.750 is 17.27875

The area of a circle with a radius of 2.750 is 23.75827

The volume of a sphere with a radius of 2.750 is 87.11367

The formulas for calculating the circumference, C, area, A, and volume, V, for a radius, r, are as follows:

C = 2πr

A = πr2

V = 4/3 πr3
