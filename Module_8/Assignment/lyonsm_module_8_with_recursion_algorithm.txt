Description: Bank management system that allows for the creation of bank accounts,
as well as transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The program
will also retrieve account details. Additionally, this program uses recursion to 
call the menu of possible actions by a presumed bank teller, Teller 1.
"""
Step 1 - imports
1. import datetime for transaction timestamps (extra feature, not required)
2. import random to generate random account numbers

Step 2 - BankAccount class
1. initialize the class with attributes for account numbers and balances 
   assigned to bank accounts
2. assign each attribute a beginning value
   account number = None
   balance = 0

Step 3 - Bank class
1. initialize with:
   - a set to hold unique account numbers
   - a dictionary to hold the account objects (account number, balance)
   - initial deposit values when creating an account
2. method to create a new account
   - request initial deposit through user input
   - use a while loop to assign a randomized, unique account number
   - store the account number in the dictionary of account objects if it doesn't exist
   - create a timestamp for use in the confirmation message
   - create printed confirmation message(s)
   - return the new account created for use in other methods
3. method to get an account (helper method - not on menu)
   - retrieves an account number from the account objects and returns it for use in
     other methods
4. method to retrieve all accounts
   - retrieves all existing accounts
   - prints a list of all accounts with their corresponding balances
   - if no accounts exist, the user is alerted
5. method to get an account balance
   - takes in an account number as input
   - prints the corresponding account balance
   - if the account doesn't exist, the user is alerted
6. method to deposit funds
   - takes in an account number as input
   - if the account exists, the user is asked how much to deposit
   - the deposit amount is added to the account balance
   - timestamp is created for use in confirmation message
   - deposit confirmation message is printed
   - if the account does not exist, the user is alerted and no transaction takes place
7. method to withdraw funds
   - very similar to the deposit method
   - takes in an account number as input
   - if the account exists, the user is asked how much to withdraw
   - the withdrawal amount is subtracted from the account balance
   - timestamp is created for use in confirmation message
   - withdrawal confirmation message is printed
   - if the account does not exist, the user is alerted and no transaction takes place
8. method to transfer funds between accounts
   - takes in two inputs, one for each account involved in the transfer
   - if both accounts exist, user is prompted for value to transfer
   - if the first account has insufficient funds, the transfer is denied
   - otherwise, the value is subtracted from the first account and added to the second
   - timestamp is created for use in the confirmation message
   - transfer confirmation message is printed
   - if either or both of the accounts does not exist, the user is alerted and no transaction 
     takes place

Step 3 - Execute choice function
1. takes in the new_client Bank object (created in the main function)
2. prompts the user to choose from a menu of account creation and transaction operations
3. each menu item triggers the corresponding method to complete the chosen operation
4. an extra option has been included to allow for retrieving a list of all accounts created
   - this makes it easy to see which accounts can be transacted upon
   - avoids scrolling through the output to find account numbers
5. the user is alerted when an invalid option is chosen

Step 4 - Continue operation function
1. recursive function to prompt the teller regarding their desire to complete an additional 
   operation after a previous operation has been completed
2. if the teller answers yes, the execute choice function is triggered
3. if the teller enters an invalid response, an alert is printed
4. if the teller answers no, the program exits with a message

Step 5 - Main function
1. prints a welcome message to the teller
2. establishes the new client Bank object
3. initializes the program with the execute choice function to prompt the teller for the initial
   transaction
