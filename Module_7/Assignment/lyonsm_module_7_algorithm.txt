Description: 
"""

Empirically, take two sorting algorithms and prove (with timestamps evidence) which one is better.

In this module, there are 5 sorting algorithms available. Write your own program to generate a large number of random numbers and sort them using any two algorithms. Add time stamps (you can use the sample program I have provided in the module contents) and prove that one algorithm is more efficient than the other one.

Note: Unless you generate a large amount of data, you might not be able to get differentiating data.

The grading will be based on the answers to the following questions:

Are you able to create a large number of random numbers and keep them in a list?
Can you feed this list to any two sorting functions (you can/should use the ones provided)?
Did you add the time stamps to determine when you are about the call the sorting function(s) and when you finish determining the time (in milliseconds) it took to sort the data?
Are you able to determine which algorithm is better?
Can you describe, in your own words, (in less than 3 lines!), which algorithm is more efficient?
Does your program follow the coding guidelines and is it commented appropriately?
