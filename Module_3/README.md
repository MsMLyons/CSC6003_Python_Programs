Assignment: Array Operations

Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and calculates the sum of all the elements in the array.
Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and finds the maximum and minimum values in the array.
Write a Python program that takes two arrays of integers as input and calculates their element-wise sum. The two arrays should have the same length.
Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and removes all duplicate elements, keeping only the unique elements in the array.
Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and sorts the elements in ascending order.
Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Write a Python program that takes an array of integers as input and calculates the average (mean) of all the elements in the array.
Example test cases:

# Test cases for the functions

array1 = [3, 9, 2, 6, 1, 8, 5]

array2 = [4, 2, 9, 5, 1, 6, 8]

array3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

array4 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Instructions:

- For each question, write a separate function that solves the problem.

- Test your functions by calling them with different input arrays in the main program.

- You can use any built-in functions or methods available for arrays in Python.
